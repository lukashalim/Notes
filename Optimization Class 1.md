### Definition of Optimization - best preformance with limited resources

### Linear programming: *MAIN TOOL* Allocation, blending and covering problems
- Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a sophisticated linear programming approach to evaluating the efficiency of similar businesses or operating units. 
- Network models: Transhipment, Traveling salesman, etc.
- Integer and mixed integer programing: Usage of binary variables in optimization
### Nonlinear optimization
- Example: best portfolio return at given level of risk
- Optimization & Simulation: Chance constraints,  uncertain objective functions
 - How to come up with quick answer without rerunning monte carlo many times
