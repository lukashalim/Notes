Seasonality
 - S is defined as the seasonal period
 - Three ways to model seasonality
  - Seasonal dummy variables
   - indicate a specific time point
   - can only use 1 less dummy variable than # of seasons
   - Disadvantages: gives equal weight of all the previous months... recent seasons are not weighted more.  But isn't last January usually more related to this January?
  - Trigonometric functions
  - Seasonal ARIMA models
