The reason we teach SPSS - some first just use SPSS and don't have SAS.  Three 1.5 hour sessions.
Designed for people who wanted to avoid code and instead point-and-click, though it does allow you to code.
We are using a just-released version, 22.  Noticed a couple of bugs.
SPSS 21.0 tutorial is available on the moodle

Data Editor interface looks very similar to excel.  Variables in columns, rows with data.  Variable view is essentially your code book.  

Open => New => Syntax opens a code window.  Every dataset has its own syntax window, output window, and scripts window.

### Variable View 
- Missing data shows up as a .  You can code missing values as well, using "Discrete Missing Values"
- Measure options let you set as Nominal, Ordinal, Scale (continuous)
- Role lets you set your target
- You can add and delete variables from the variable view.

### Data View
- You can also add variables here with a right-click menu option

With cluster analysis, wrong variable types can cause problems.

Same menu bar options regardless of which view you are looking at.

### Options
- you can readch this by clicking Edit => Options
- On the output tab, Dr. D likes to switch all the options on the left to "values and labels"

### Transform
- Compute variable option 
 - allows you to create new variables using calculations on existing values.
 - Clicking the "If.." will allow you to subset your data according to a criteria.
- Recode
 - Probably best to use "recode into different..." so that you don't overwrite
 - You can use ranges.  Ranges are inclusive.

### Syntax View
- Use asterisk to comment
- Like SAS, will run code you have highlighted.  If nothing is highlighted, runs all your code.
- Always be careful to save

### Output Window
- Will give you a log with warnings.
