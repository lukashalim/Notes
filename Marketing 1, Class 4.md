### Steps in Factor Analysis
- Drop Variables which could cause problems for FA
 - Drop variables that are uncorrelated with all other variables < .25 or .3 as these can mess up analysis
 - Sometimes highly correlated variables > .99 can also cause issues.   May want to drop.
- Test for factorability
 - Bartlett's test of sphericity: uses a chi-squared test to see whether intercorrelation matrix is an identity matrix
 - Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of sampling adequacy (KMO).  
  - 1 => perfectly factorable. 
  - 0 => totally unfactorable
  - .7 is very good
  - Greater than .5 => don't try to factor
- Extract an initial solution
 - normally takes place based on the eigenvalue
 - rule of thumb - explain at least 70% of the variance
 - rule of thumb - do not use factors with an eigenvalue less than 1
 - determine the appropriate number of ffactors to be extracted in the final solution
 - if there is one factor that loads highly to a single factor, then you have a factor structure that is not interpretable
- if the initial solution is uninterpretable, rotate the factors
 - rotation can larify the factor pattern in order to better interpet the nature of factors
 - changing the loadings
 - methods of rotation
  - Orthogonal methods
   - *Varimax* Rotation maximizes the variance of the factors (Dr. D says this is typically best)
   - quartimax method: maximize the variance of the squared loadings of each variable
   - equimax method: tries to combine the objectives of both marimax and quartimax methods
  - oblique rotation methods
   - direct oblimin (use a measure called delta)
   - promax methods (use a measure called kappa)
   - delta and kappa show you how correlated your factors are at the end
   - to use these, you have to have a sense of the correlaton that already exists
 - factors still remain orthogonal, but now we have some high loadings and some low loadings
 - communalities are identical to the factors prior to rotation
 - you may find that there are some variables that have high loadings in two factors or low loadings in all factors - those are the ones that are problematic and may need to be dropped.
  - This is a problem with any unsupervised learning method: there is no easy criteria for what is a good solution
- depending on subsequent applications, compute a factor score for each subject on each factor
- Reliability Analysis
- Factor scores are linear combinations of the observed variables which consider what is shared between the variables and the factor (communality) and the unique variance
 - regression scores
 - bartlett scores
 - andersonrubin scores
- Methods
 - principal components methods
 - common factor analysis
  - more intepretable than principal components, but with lower % variation explained
  - principal axis method
  - maximum likelihood method
 - unweighted least-squares
 - generalized least squares
 - alpha method
 - image factoring

Eigenvalues measure the amount of variation in the total sample accounted for by each factor

- Definitions
 - Communality: the amount of variation explained by the factor solution
 - factor loadings: correlation coefficients between variables and factors
 - oblique rotation: specialized method that allow nonorthoganal factors
