### Color: Theoretical and practical applications of color
- physical
 - electrocmagnetic energy in the 400nm (violet) to 700 (red) wavelength region
 - amount of energy of some wavelength lamda is represented by a function p(lamda)
  - dominant wavlength: the hue you see when you view p(lambda)
  - excitiation purity: the strength of color
  - In colorimetry, metamerism is the matching of apparent color of objects with different spectral power distributions.
- perceptual
 - hue
 - saturation (excitation purity)
 - brightness
 - preceived color varies on viewing enviornment
 - eye has rods (for lowlight conditions) and cones
 - rods provide similar luminous response function. respond most strongly to light in green wavelength.
 - colorblindness: about 15% of males are colorblind
 - Does ability to describe color (or other features) linguistically help you to notice more subtle differences?
  - Berlin & Kay studied 98 different linguistic cultures

-printing
 - pantone: monitor colors = printer colors
 
-choosing a color scheme
 - Colorbrewer
  - sequential (low to high)
  - diverging (positive & negative)
  - qualitative (distinguishable categoreis)
