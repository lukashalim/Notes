### More on Factor Analysis
- Use covariance when all your variables are on the same scale
- factor loadings: correlations between variables and factors.  
- communality: amount of variance in variable that is explained by the factor solution

When to drop factors?
- correlation matrix
- variables with high or low loadings on all factors
- KMO

### Clustering Techniques
- Standardization
 - Range Standardization tends to work better than using z-scores
- Hierarchical clustering
 - Types
  - Agglomerative
  - Divisive
 - Advantages
  - don't need to specify # of clusters ahead of time
 - disadvantages
  - cases can't move between clusters
- Nonhierarchical clustering
 - allows values to move between groups
 
### Definitions
Standardization is modifying a variable relative to the rest of your data
