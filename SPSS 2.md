==== Data
- Define Dates - dates work similarly to SAS, where there is a date = 1, and we count from there
- Multiple Response Sets - mutliselect data.  doesn't seem like there is any cool analytics that go with this.
- Identify duplicate cases - Case is the same as an observation in SAS
- Compare Datasets - see which variables are different, are the labels different
- Rake Weights - if your sample is not representative, you need to correct for this when you make inferences about the opulation
 - Procedure called "raking" will ask what variables you want to weight, and what does your population look like?
- Select Cases: Run analysis with a subset of the cases


Analyze
- OLAP Cubes: Generates descriptive statistics by different categorical variables
- Case Summaries: Give you summary for all the caes by variable
- Descriptive Statistics: frequency, std dev, etc
- SPSS has charts, but not really that great.  Dr. D prefers JMP or Excel for creating charts
- Trimmed mean - since mean is sensitive to outliers.  5% trimmed mean is sort of the standard.
- TURF: unduplicated region frequency check that no one is being double-counted
- Ratio: mean, median, mode
- PP plots: probability plots for all the variables
- Panels: allow you to pt multiple charts on the same graph

Question: Why would you want to standardize variables 
 - different types of distributions will need different types of distributions

Question: It looks like SPSS has certification exams.  Are these worthwhile?
