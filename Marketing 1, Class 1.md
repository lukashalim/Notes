Marketing Analytics - trying to influence customer behavior to increase profit.

Variables

- TARPs: Television Rating Points
- Broad Categories: Market, Media, Creative (promotional campaigns), Offer, Competitor

### Curriculum - Marketing Analytics Tools:
- Market Segmentation (Module 1) - Questionaries, types of segementations, factor analysis, predictive modeling (SPSS/SAS)
Design of Experiments and Conjoint Analysis (Module 2)
 - will focus more on design of experiments because employers have been requesting
- Miscellaneous Marketing Models (Module 3)
 - Marketing mix models
 - Maket Basket Analysis
 - Customer Life Time Value Models
 - Web Analytics (same techniques, somewhat different jargon)
 
Brown bags on weighting of data
Brown bag on structural equation modeling

### Market Segmentation
- Cluster seeks to minimize within-cluster differences, and maximize between-cluster differences
- Developing the right segmentation solution is difficult
- Why is market segmentaton important
 - Market segmentation is important because not all buyers are the same.  buysers may differ in their needs, locations, resources available, buying attitudes and buying practices
 - Even a small segment may be valuable if no one is targeting them
- Objectives of segmentation
 - Wha are the existing needs of the customer
 - Who will buy my product
 - How many segments are there with different propensities of buying product
 - What are the "markets" for each segment
 - Based on my needs and product features, which segments are good targets
 - How do I best reach those who are most likely to buy my products?
  - How to I advertise to a particular segment
- Commonly Used Segmentation
 - Demographic (age/generation)
  - Boomer: Born between 1946 and 1964
  - Generation X: Between 1965 and 1980
  - Echo Boomer / Gen Y: Born between 1981 and 1995
  - Generation Z: Born after 1995
  - Income: Used heavily by automobiles
  - Gender: Volkswagen Bettle originally pitched to women
 - Geography
  - Home Depot tried to open some Home Depot Lite stores in less populous areas
  - Wall*Mart Supercenter / Regular
 - Psychographic Segmentation
  - Dos Equis Man: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Interesting_Man_in_the_World
 - Behavioral Segmentation
  - Loyalty
  - Usage: 
   - telcom looks at how we are using devices, attempt to cross-sell based on these.  
   - Hyundi assurance program: if you loose you job, you can go without payment for one year without any impact on your credit score.  Added a clause during the federal shutdown.
  - Purchase Patterns
 - Benefit Segmentation
  - EX Toothpaste
   - Economic (low price) - men
   - Medicinal (low price) - conservative large families
   - Cosmetic (bight teeth) - smokers, highly social
   - Taste - children, those with high self-involvement
- Man or child may be using the item, but the woman may be purchasing
- Effective Segmentation:
 - Accessible
 - Actionable
 - Substantial
 - Measurable
 - Differentiable
- Binary variables are not always great for segmentation... sometimes better to leave them out, or create subsegments with them

### Evaluating Market Segments
- How do companies evaluate and select target segments
 - segement size and growth
 - segment structural attractiveness
 - Company resources and objectives

### Market Segmentation Methods
- Non-Modeled Form - group observations based on som criteria
- Modeled Form - clustering

### Technical Considerations
- Need 400-600 minimum; 1000+ typical; needs to be representitive
- Standardize prior to clustering
- Similarity Metrics - euclidean distance, manhattan distance, hamming
 - Criteria for good metric:
  - Symmetry: Distance(x,y) = Distance(y,x)
  - Non-identical distinguihability: Distance(x,y) => x != y
  - identical non-distinguishability: Distance(x,y) => x = y
 - Correlation isn't always good, b/c (1,2) is perfectly correlated with (100,200)!
 - Euclidean Distance is the most common measure

- How do companies cator to different segments?
 - Perception is reality! (yick)
 - May change label
