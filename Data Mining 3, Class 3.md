### Neural Nets
Hidden units are also called neurons

### Radial Basis
Use normal curves rather than hyperbolic tangent

### Nearest Neighbor Analysis

### Memory Based Reasoning


### Maximum Likelihood
Given that I've seen the x values, what distribution would be most likely to have produced those x values?

### Trees
Gradient boosting and Random Forests - should learn how these work.
