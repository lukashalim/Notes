Power and Sample Size
- Power: 1-Beta. The chance that one detects a difference from the null hypothesis, if a difference as extreme as the alternative exists
- Power usually set to 80% or more, but you have to think about the consequences of a Type II error.
- For the same effect size, the higher the power the higher the sample size required
- Smaller alpha => lower power
- smaller standard deviation => higher power

- Prospetive vs. Retrospective Power Analysis
 - Prospective is *good*, while retrospective is *bad*
 
- Power for binomial distribution (for example, response to credit card offer)
 - distribution is not continuous, so PROC POWER always give an alpha that is below your specified alpha
