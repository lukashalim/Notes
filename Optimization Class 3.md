Shadow or Dual Prices
- delta(obj) / delta(constraint)
- whenever constraint is not binding, shadow price is zero
- Geometrically, we are expanding the box

Adding new product
- Always look at shadow prices to get a feeling for what is going on.  

Reduced Cost (also sometimes called opportunity cost)
- This is a very *misleading term*
- for maximization problems, shows how much the coefficient will increase in absolute terms
- answers the question, "what price will make it profitable to produce more"
- marginal profit minus the per-unit value of the resources
- occurs when it is optimal when an input variable is at its minimum (typically 0)
- if the coefficient in the objective function decreased by the reduced cost, then it woud be optimal to produce over the minimum amount (tyically 0)

Most important step in linear programming - setting up the problem

Covering Models
- Minimizing costs
